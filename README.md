# figma-mcp-server
Connect Figma to Claude via MCP

---

This method is about **governance** (auditing and maintaining quality), not **implementation**!

### Use Figma's native MCP when:
- You want to generate code from designs
- You're implementing new UI from Figma mockups
- You need Code Connect integration

### Use this custom server when:
- You need to audit naming conventions across your design system
- You want to analyze component consistency
- You need bulk queries across hundreds of components
- You want Claude to help maintain design system quality

Besides, most official MCPs (like Figma‚Äôs) only work with Dev Mode and follow a freemium model. This server bypasses that limitation by allowing direct access to file data via the public API. And it‚Äôs completely free! üíØ


# Start here ‚Üì

No coding needed, just configuration. Feel free to audit the files yourself, or run them through an LLM for a quick review.

## Download the project files

Before starting, <a href="https://github.com/zeitmaschinen/figma-mcp-server/" target="_blank">download the project files here</a> and extract the ZIP to your computer.

This ZIP file contains:
- Pre-compiled server code (ready to use!)
- All configuration files
- Empty `.env` file for your Figma token

---

## Step by Step

### Step 1: Install Node.js

**What is it?** A program that allows you to run JavaScript code on your computer.

**How to install:**

1. Go to: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Click the big button labeled **"Download Node.js (LTS)"**
3. Wait for the download to finish
4. Click the downloaded file and follow the installer
5. When finished, click "Finish"

**You can test if it worked:**

- **Windows:** Press `Windows + R`, type `cmd` and press Enter
- **Mac:** Press `Command + Space`, type `terminal` and press Enter

In the window that opened, type:

```bash
node --version
```

Press Enter. If something like `v23.10.0` appears, it worked!

---

### Step 2: Extract project files

1. Locate the downloaded ZIP file: `figma-mcp-server-main.zip`
2. **Right-click** on the ZIP file
3. Choose **"Extract All..."** (Windows) or **"Unzip"** (Mac)
4. Choose a location (for example, /Documents/ folder)
5. Click **"Extract"**

You should now have a folder called `figma-mcp-server-main` with these files inside:

```
/figma-mcp-server-main/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/         (source code for reference)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ server.ts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env         (you'll add your Figma token here)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.json
```

---

### Step 3: Open terminal in project folder

**Windows:**
1. Open the `figma-mcp-server-main` folder
2. Hold **Shift** and **right-click** in an empty area
3. Select **"Open PowerShell window here"** or **"Open Command Prompt here"**

**Mac:**
1. Open **Terminal** (Command + Space, type "terminal")
2. Type `cd ` (with a space after)
3. Drag the `figma-mcp-server-main` folder into the terminal window
4. Press Enter

---

### Step 4: Install dependencies (usually 3 min)

In the terminal (**inside the project folder**), type:

```bash
npm install
```

Press Enter and wait (may take 1-3 minutes). This will install all dependencies required to run the server.

When finished, all the necessary libraries will be downloaded into a `node_modules` folder.

---

### Step 5: Get your Figma token

#### 5.1: Generate token

1. Open your browser
2. Go to: [https://www.figma.com/](https://www.figma.com/)
3. Log in if necessary
4. Click on **your name** (top left corner) and select **Settings**
5. Click on the **Security** tab
6. **Scroll down** until you find the **"Personal access tokens"** section
7. Click the **"Generate new token"** button
8. Give the token a name (example: "Claude MCP")
9. Click **"Generate token"**
10. **COPY THE TOKEN** that appeared (it's a long sequence like `figd_ABC123...`)
11. **IMPORTANT:** Save this token somewhere safe, you won't be able to see it again once you close Figma's window.

---

#### 5.2: Add token to .env file

1. In the `figma-mcp-server-main` folder, open the `.env` file in a text editor (Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac)
2. You'll see just: `FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN=`
3. **Paste your copied token after the equals sign**
4. Should look like: `FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN=figd_XYZ123ABC...`
5. **Save the file**

**Example:**
```
FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN=figd_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6
```

---

### Step 6: Build the server

Now we need to compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript that Node.js can run.

In the terminal (inside the project folder), type:
```bash
npm run build
```

Press Enter and wait. You'll see some output, and a new build/ folder will be created inside your main folder.

---

### Step 7: Configure Claude desktop (circa 10 min)

#### 7.1: Find your project's complete path

In the terminal (inside the project folder), type:

**Windows:**

```bash
cd
```

**Mac/Linux:**

```bash
pwd
```

Something like this will appear:

- **Windows:** `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\figma-mcp-server-main`
- **Mac:** `/Users/yourname/Documents/figma-mcp-server-main`

**Copy this complete path**! Write it down, you'll need it in the next step.

---

#### 7.2: Find Claude's configuration file

**On Mac:**

1. Open Finder
2. Press `Command + Shift + G`
3. Paste: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude`
4. Press Enter
5. Look for the file: `claude_desktop_config.json`

**On Windows:**

1. Press `Windows + R`
2. Paste: `%APPDATA%\Claude`
3. Press Enter
4. Look for the file: `claude_desktop_config.json`

**If the file DOESN'T EXIST:**

- Create a new file named `claude_desktop_config.json` in that folder
- You can create it in Notepad or TextEdit

---

#### 7.3: Edit the configuration file

1. Open the `claude_desktop_config.json` file in Notepad or TextEdit
2. **DELETE EVERYTHING** that's in there (if anything exists, make a backup first)
3. Paste this content:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "figma-design-system": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "PASTE_PATH_HERE/build/server.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN": "PASTE_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

4. **Replace:**
    - `PASTE_PATH_HERE` with the path you copied in Step 7.1
    - `PASTE_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` with your Figma token

**Final example (Mac):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "figma-design-system": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/Users/maria/Documents/figma-mcp-server-main/build/server.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN": "figd_ABC123XYZ..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Final example (Windows):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "figma-design-system": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "C:\\Users\\Maria\\Documents\\figma-mcp-server-main\\build\\server.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN": "figd_ABC123XYZ..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

5. Save the file

---

### Step 8: Activate in Claude desktop

1. **Completely CLOSE** Claude Desktop (on Mac: Command + Q, on Windows: right-click taskbar icon and choose "Quit")
2. Open Claude Desktop again

---

### Step 9: Test with Claude

Now go to Claude Desktop and ask:

```
Claude, show me all the components from my Figma file!
File key: ABC123XYZ
```

**How to get your file key:**
1. Click the "Share" button in the top-right corner of the Figma interface.
2. Select "Copy link" to copy the file URL.
3. Paste the link somewhere so you can view it. It will look like one of these:
  - https://www.figma.com/file/ABC123XYZ/File-Name
  - https://www.figma.com/design/ABC123XYZ/File-Name
4. Copy the part between /file/ or /design/ and the next /. In this example: ABC123XYZ ‚Üê This is your file key.

## Verification checklist

1. Node.js is installed (check if `node --version` works)
2. Project files are extracted
3. `npm install` completed successfully
4. `.env` file has your Figma token
5. `claude_desktop_config.json` has the correct path with proper slashes
6. `claude_desktop_config.json` has your Figma token
7. Claude Desktop was completely closed and reopened

## Design System management commands - What can you ask?
Remember to always provide the file key to Claude in your initial request or whenever you want to analyze a new file. Otherwise, it will ask for it. üòä
